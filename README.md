# Point_and_Sort


## Summary
A C application utilizing pointers and dynamic memory, as part of an assignment for a college course. The program essentially takes a sentence, separates, and outputs each word from the sentence, taking into account the spaces between each word.

## Purpose
Aside from being a mandatory assignment, the project served to take the lessons learned from the tokenizer assignment and apply them one step further into this program. Though a bit limiting, the program has more accessability and usability than the tokenizer application. Unlike the tokenizer, this assignment was created from scatch, along with the help of my partner, further demonstrating my progression in programming and working alongside others.

## Instructions
The program was run through an IDE. (I believe i used Eclipse for this program)
