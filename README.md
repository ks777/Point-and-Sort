# Point_and_Sort

## Summary
A C application utilizing pointers and dynamic memory, as part of an assignment for a college course. The program essentially takes a sentence, separates it, and outputs each word from the sentence taking into account the spaces between each word.

## Purpose
Aside from being a mandatory assignment, the project served to take the lessons learned from the tokenizer assignment and apply them one step further into this program. Though a bit limiting, the program has more accessibility and usability than the tokenizer application. Unlike the tokenizer, this assignment was created from scratch, along with the help of my partner at the time.

## Instructions
The program was run through an IDE of your choice.
